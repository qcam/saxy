Saxy
===

Saxy (Sá xị) is an XML SAX parser and encoder in Elixir that focuses on speed, usability and standard compliance.

Comply with [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/).

## Features highlight

* An incredibly fast XML 1.0 SAX parser.
* An extremely fast XML encoder.
* Native support for streaming parsing large XML files.
* Parse XML documents into simple DOM format.
* Support quick returning in event handlers.

## Installation

Add `:saxy` to your `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:saxy, "~> 0.9.0"}]
end
```

## Overview

Full documentation is available on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/saxy/).

### SAX parser

A SAX event handler implementation is required before starting parsing.

```elixir
defmodule MyEventHandler do
  @behaviour Saxy.Handler

  def handle_event(:start_document, prolog, state) do
    IO.inspect("Start parsing document")
    {:ok, [{:start_document, prolog} | state]}
  end

  def handle_event(:end_document, _data, state) do
    IO.inspect("Finish parsing document")
    {:ok, [{:end_document} | state]}
  end

  def handle_event(:start_element, {name, attributes}, state) do
    IO.inspect("Start parsing element #{name} with attributes #{inspect(attributes)}")
    {:ok, [{:start_element, name, attributes} | state]}
  end

  def handle_event(:end_element, name, state) do
    IO.inspect("Finish parsing element #{name}")
    {:ok, [{:end_element, name} | state]}
  end

  def handle_event(:characters, chars, state) do
    IO.inspect("Receive characters #{chars}")
    {:ok, [{:chacters, chars} | state]}
  end
end
```

Then start parsing XML documents with:

```elixir
iex> xml = "<?xml version='1.0' ?><foo bar='value'></foo>"
iex> Saxy.parse_string(xml, MyEventHandler, [])
{:ok,
 [{:end_document},
  {:end_element, "foo"},
  {:start_element, "foo", [{"bar", "value"}]},
  {:start_document, [version: "1.0"]}]}
```

### Streaming parsing

Saxy also accepts file stream as the input:

```elixir
stream = File.stream!("/path/to/file")

Saxy.parse_stream(stream, MyEventHandler, initial_state)
```

It even supports parsing a normal stream.

```elixir
stream = File.stream!("/path/to/file") |> Stream.filter(&(&1 != "\n"))

Saxy.parse_stream(stream, MyEventHandler, initial_state)
```

### Simple DOM format exporting

Sometimes it will be convenient to just export the XML document into simple DOM
format, which is a 3-element tuple including the tag name, attributes, and a
list of its children.

`Saxy.SimpleForm` module has this nicely supported:

```elixir
Saxy.SimpleForm.parse_string(data)

{"menu", [],
 [
   {"movie",
    [{"id", "tt0120338"}, {"url", "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/"}],
    [{"name", [], ["Titanic"]}, {"characters", [], ["Jack &amp; Rose"]}]},
   {"movie",
    [{"id", "tt0109830"}, {"url", "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/"}],
    [
      {"name", [], ["Forest Gump"]},
      {"characters", [], ["Forest &amp; Jenny"]}
    ]}
 ]}
```

### xmerl format exporting

Saxy supports exporting to xmerl format, which you could then use for xmerl_xpath
or SweetXML.

Note that xmerl format requires tag and attribute names to be atoms. By default Saxy
uses `String.to_existing_atom/1` to avoid runtime atom creation. You could override
this behaviour by specifying `:atom_fun` option to `String.to_atom/1`.

```elixir
iex> string = File.read!("/path/to/my.xml")
iex> Saxy.Xmerl.parse_string(string, atom_fun: &String.to_atom/1)
{:ok,
 {:xmlElement,
  :foo,
  :foo,
  [],
  {:xmlNamespace, [], []},
  [],
  1,
  [{:xmlAttribute, :bar, :bar, [], [], [], 1, [], 'value', :undefined}],
  [],
  [],
  [],
  :undeclared}}
```

### XML builder

Saxy offers two APIs to build simple form and encode XML document.

Use `Saxy.XML` to build and compose XML simple form, then `Saxy.encode!/2`
to encode the built element into XML binary.

```elixir
iex> import Saxy.XML
iex> element = element("person", [gender: "female"], "Alice")
{"person", [{"gender", "female"}], [{:characters, "Alice"}]}
iex> Saxy.encode!(element, [])
"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><person gender=\"female\">Alice</person>"
```

See `Saxy.XML` for more XML building APIs.

Saxy also provides `Saxy.Builder` protocol to help composing structs into simple form.

```elixir
defmodule Person do
  @derive {Saxy.Builder, name: "person", attributes: [:gender], children: [:name]}

  defstruct [:gender, :name]
end

iex> jack = %Person{gender: :male, name: "Jack"}
iex> john = %Person{gender: :male, name: "John"}
iex> import Saxy.XML
iex> root = element("people", [], [jack, john])
iex> Saxy.encode!(root, [])
"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><people><person gender=\"male\">Jack</person><person gender=\"male\">John</person></people>"
```

### Benchmarking

Benchmarking in XML is hard and highly depends on the complexity of the
document. Saxy usually yields **1.4 times** better than [Erlsom](https://github.com/willemdj/erlsom)
in benchmark results. With deeply nested documents, it is particularly noticeably
faster with [**4.35 times faster**](https://github.com/qcam/saxy-bench#soccer-11mb-xml-file-1).

As for XML builder, Saxy is usually 4 times faster than [xml_builder](https://github.com/joshnuss/xml_builder) on
simple element encoding, and 17 times faster in deeply nested elements encoding.

The benchmark suite can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/qcam/saxy-bench).

### Limitations

* No XSD supported.
* No DTD supported, when the parser encounters a `<!DOCTYPE`, it simply stops parsing.

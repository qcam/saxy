# Saxy

Saxy is a XML SAX parser which provides functions to parse XML file in both binary and streaming way.
Comply with [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/).

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:saxy, "~> 0.2.0"}]
end
```

## Overview

Full documentation is available on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/saxy/).

A SAX event handler implementation is required before starting parsing.

```elixir
defmodule MyEventHandler do
  @behaviour Saxy.Handler

  def handle_event(:start_document, prolog, state) do
    IO.inspect "Start parsing document"
    [{:start_document, prolog} | state]
  end

  def handle_event(:end_document, _data, state) do
    IO.inspect "Finish parsing document"
    [{:end_document} | state]
  end

  def handle_event(:start_element, {name, attributes}, state) do
    IO.inspect "Start parsing element #{name} with attributes #{inspect(attributes)}"
    [{:start_element, name, attributes} | state]
  end

  def handle_event(:end_element, {name}, state) do
    IO.inspect "Finish parsing element #{name}"
    [{:end_element, name} | state]
  end

  def handle_event(:characters, chars, state) do
    IO.inspect "Receive characters #{chars}"
    [{:chacters, chars} | state]
  end
end
```

Then parse your XML with:

```elixir
initial_state = []

Saxy.parse_string(data, MyEventHandler, initial_state)
```

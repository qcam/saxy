            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Guess what? They’re language gaps.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IUtJbFXUfkvYAWzkdbYUdQ.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote>Words have a genealogy and it’s easier to trace the evolution of a single word than the evolution of a language. — Daniel C. Dennett</blockquote><p>The blockchain ecosystem is rapidly growing and becoming more complex every day. There are more than <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/">1,541</a> different cryptocurrencies currently¹ on the market, and numbers have been steadily increasing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">157 new ones</a> added since January 7th of 2018.</p><p>This abstract crypto-web is already facing several problems. Most notably are the development barriers for entry, incompatible blockchain environments, and <em>integration into the real world</em>. <a href="https://iolite.io/">iOlite</a>, a new blockchain technology, is helping to solve these three issues in very advanced ways.</p><p>The platform is creating a bridge between natural and programming languages, through its unique Fast Adaptation Engine (<a href="https://medium.com/@iolite/explanation-of-iolite-flow-and-its-fae-ddab3db2d6c7">FAE</a>) design — using <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4408.pdf">lambda DCS</a> and HCI <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/wang2017naturalizing.pdf">research</a> at Stanford University. People will be able to convert any formal computing <em>and</em> spoken language, such as English, into any desired programming or natural languages. This would be a massive accomplishment for human-machine interaction, as well as a modular computational solution that will bootstrap blockchain adoption. This is already appearing quite industry-changing, but the deeper implications will reveal to be much more profound.</p><h3>The Tip of the Iceberg</h3><p>At the surface, iOlite is engineering translations for natural languages to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity">Solidity</a> (a programming language for Ethereum). This will open the gates for people and businesses to independently design &amp; implement <em>smart contracts </em>in their companies, professions, or personal lives; in a naturally understandable way.</p><blockquote><strong>Smart contracts</strong> are simply an evolved digital medium for regular contracts. Being on a blockchain allows for new, useful qualities in a contract, through a publicly-verifiable, inalterable chain of chronological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">signed</a> events. Ethereum has the added utility of its <a href="https://themerkle.com/what-is-the-ethereum-virtual-machine/">virtual machine</a>, which allows programmability on top of its blockchain. This is how smart contracts have leverage over their traditional predecessors — they can be automated, autonomous, and freely audited. They can <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/smart-contracts-are-taking-over-functions-of-lawyers-expert-blog">replace</a> intermediary actors and services, while formally guaranteeing outcomes and executions by specification. Not only does this significantly reduce operational costs, it also makes infrastructure more efficient; and best of all, smart contracts are immune to coercion and corruption. So naturally, iOlite will initially piggyback on its own Ethereum-forked blockchain, taking advantage of these existing mechanisms.</blockquote><p>Two of <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/signals-for-strategists/using-blockchain-for-smart-contracts.html"><em>many</em></a> benefiting sectors that instantly come to mind are law and insurance.</p><h4>Don’t slip on the way down… Unless you’re insured</h4><p>A core tenet of insurance is the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uberrima_fides">utmost good faith</a>. This legal doctrine declares that both parties in a contract of insurance have a duty to communicate honest and factually-complete information, especially pertaining to conditions outlined by a broker’s policies. The definition is inherently weak, because it hinges on <em>faith</em>, a notion which is highly exploitable.</p><p>The current approach to circumvent the uncertainty of faith is through legal accountability. Most of us know that this is not an ideal solution. Fraudulent insurance claims steal over <a href="http://www.insurancefraud.org/statistics.htm#1">$80 billion</a> annually.</p><p>Smart contracts <em>necessitate</em> honesty and facts. Inherently, they will <strong>only</strong> function based on discrete inputs and outputs that engaging parties agree on.</p><p>“Faith” is no longer required.</p><p>To illustrate this superior doctrine, first consider a seemingly mundane transaction that every insured entity participates in: <em>After an underwriter analyzes and approves an insurance policy, a client makes the calculated payment and receives the legal paper proving their policy by mail.</em></p><p>At the insurance company where my mother works, an agent was perpetrating fraud through the sale of fake proof-of-insurance documents. If this process was automated in a <strong>smart contract</strong>, the mediating role of this corrupt agent would be pointless. A smart contract could be designed so that when a client makes her payment, the documentation is automatically and instantly transmitted to her through electronic mediums, e.g. the company’s mobile app — with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key</a> ID to authenticate against their database.</p><p>A lot of similar businesses are lagging far behind when it comes to integrating new technology. Industry software can be quite <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=k6cRhfp2aWgC&amp;lpg=PT217&amp;ots=WzbCv_A5tP&amp;dq=chapter_4&amp;pg=PT217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">incomplete and costly</a>, and requires that everyone using it must learn a new system. Paper mail is delivered slowly, becomes quite tedious, has additional time waste &amp; financial expenses, and is insecure.</p><p>Part of the reason technological adoption is sluggish for insurance companies <em>as a whole</em>, is due to the <a href="https://medium.com/bull-market/good-ideas-are-not-enough-c88145e3166f">difficult assimilation</a> of data — rampant with legal jargon — into formalized, computationally-flexible and <strong>complete</strong> solutions. The rewards of digital integration are contingent on so many technical, financial, and time demands, that it is much safer and consistent to keep things the way they are — in fact, it may be preferable to <a href="https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/car-insurance/shopping-for-auto-insurance.aspx">subtly dismiss it altogether.</a></p><h4>One last deep breath</h4><p>We should now circle back to iOlite to realize its imminent use potential. Because of the FAE’s interdisciplinary interpretive power to translate natural language into a smart contract, developing virtualized operations &amp; infrastructure is no longer an obstacle. <strong>Everyone</strong> in a company will be able to contribute their <em>existing</em> expertise, in vocabularies they understand.</p><p>The supplementary resources available to users only adds to this efficiency — iOlite is a platform with a broader scope than just translation. It also facilitates a marketplace where completed smart contracts can be bought and sold, effectively providing an outsourcing of intellectual-labor. Other services such as security auditing of a smart contract and custom-made expressions for niche/optimized use are also available. All of this data is stored on its blockchain. By virtue of these combined features, iOlite innately curates a community of developers, researchers, industry professionals, freelancers, academics, businesses, and average users.</p><p>But remember, this is only how we see it from the <em>surface.</em></p><p>Zooming out to observe iOlite as a larger macro-system we see: a decentralized, market-driven ecology with demand for language-constructed solutions-development, fueled by a community of all sophistication levels. Pack that up, inject it in a VM-powered blockchain, and what do we find? The infancy of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_translator">universal-translator</a>, beginning as a securely distributed data-store for <strong>knowledge².</strong></p><p>This conceptual scaffolding is helpful to further address and explore the two other problems mentioned, which iOlite helps resolve.</p><h4>Goggles on? Let’s dive in</h4><p>The major drawbacks of self-isolating blockchains stem from a coupled deficiency: cross-chain connectivity + cross-chain interoperability. <a href="https://www.smartcontract.com/link">Chain Link</a> is helping solve the former, providing a secure digital nervous system for data feeds between blockchains <em>and</em> off-chain resources (such as <a href="https://sightmachine.com/industrial-internet-of-things-and-big-data/">IIoT</a> data). This is an excellent springboard for iOlite, which delivers the interoperability power through translations (equally important, if not more). When the two are married, the resulting medium is much like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)"><em>aether</em></a> (vastly more true to the etymology than Ethereum). That is to say, a seamless programmable communication protocol for every device or machine, virtual <em>and</em> physical.</p><p>So let’s begin with an industrial perspective. Returning to the untapped domain of insurance, we can outline some of many new and interesting applications:</p><ul><li><strong>Live DNA interpretation for dynamically-calculated premiums.</strong></li></ul><p>Genomics-technology companies <a href="http://biomeme.com/">could</a> one day provide personal devices and services for real-time analysis of gene sequences. Chain Link would transmit this off-chain bioinformation to iOlite, where a FAE architecture could naturalize the data into English for user-comprehension, and simultaneously translate-then-feed Solidity-coded metrics into a smart contract that modulates different policy premiums, according to conditional weightings and the relevance of an insured’s health.</p><ul><li><strong>IoT as risk monitoring and claim-verification tools.</strong></li></ul><p>Many new internet-connected technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation">home automation</a> provide useful information from real events. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_lock">smart lock</a> could provide indisputable evidence, for example, that while an insured was working overtime, her dog’s cage was unlocked during the same time a neighbour was bitten by him. If the owner tried filing a claim for liability coverage, there might be a clause in a smart contract policy which explicitly denies a claim for harm caused by animals when their containment is not secure.</p><p>The insurance provider could have an online claim filing interface which integrates iOlite FAE modules. By analyzing the semantics in the insured’s submission, even the ambiguity of a word like “dog” could <strong>alone </strong>trigger the smart contract to status-check any connected devices associated with it, such as the smart lock on its cage. This could reduce fraud significantly, by improving on the insured’s obligation for <a href="http://www.claimshelp.co.nz/reasonable-care">reasonable care</a> (or inversely, by accurately measuring negligence).</p><p><strong>Shifting the focal point away from industry is where science-fiction becomes reality.</strong></p><h3>Navigating the Depths in a Sea of Information</h3><p><strong>We are going <em>deep</em>. So turn back now if you can’t survive the pressure.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/770/1*QDKDiB1Lchm97YXfjpDDYg.png" /></figure><blockquote><em>Looking at ourselves from the computer viewpoint, we cannot avoid seeing that natural language is our most important ‘programming language.’ This means that a vast portion of our knowledge and activity is, for us, best communicated and understood in our natural language…. One could say that natural language was our first great original artifact and, since, as we increasingly realize, languages are machines, so natural language, with our brains to run it, was our primal invention of the universal computer. One could say this except for the sneaking suspicion that language isn’t something we invented but something we became, not something we constructed but something in which we created, and recreated, ourselves</em>. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leiber">Justin Leiber</a></blockquote><p>For quite some time, it has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurognosis">no longer</a> meaningful to try and argue that our minds are some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa">tabula rasa</a> in their entirety. On the contrary, the mystery of consciousness seems to be slowly unraveling as <a href="http://cogzest.com/2018/03/understanding-ourselves-with-virtual-machine-concepts/">a collection of interacting virtual machines.</a> Natural language certainly plays a crucial role in this, giving us a markedly increased range of imagination, versatility, and self control.³ Additionally, “<em>…once we have language — a bountiful kit of mind-tools — we can use them in the structure of deliberate, foresightful generate-and-test known as science.</em>”⁴</p><p>Different than standard functional definitions in most programming languages, iOlite’s FAE definitions (structures) are <em>n</em>ot declarative arguments. The FAE has to <strong>learn</strong> to <em>semantically</em> <em>identify</em> arguments from concrete values entered by the user, in order to create a parsable generalization. A fascinating capability of this is that natural language utterances needn’t be in a grammar-strict sequential order. Contributors incrementally and interactively help the FAE to learn languages they decide, by pruning incorrect interpretations and accepting correct ones. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurognosis">neurognostic</a> likeness of a human brain is replicated by the FAE’s core language which users are bound to initially. While this is an unavoidable bedrock for the early adopters, newcomers will be able to take advantage of progress already made.</p><p>The mathematics underlying FAE’s linguistic marvels ushers in even more surprisingly <em>human</em>-like capacities. An imported structuring of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/discourse-representation-theory">discourse representation theory</a> allows machines “…a mental representation built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds.”<strong> </strong>Then putting the cherry on top, similarly integrated is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory">relevance theory</a>, where “…by the act of making an utterance, the speaker is conveying that what they have said is worth listening to, i.e. it will provide “cognitive effects” worthy of the processing effort required to find the meaning.”</p><p>Whilst these characteristics are certainly impacting individually, in fusion they illuminate a unique characteristic… <em>what we have is something much different than AI or machine learning</em>, it is better describable as a crucial precursor — a missing link — machine <em>training (i.e. learning to </em><strong><em>learn</em></strong><em>).</em></p><blockquote>The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim. — Edsger W. Dijkstra</blockquote><p>All this has been building up to the final conclusions which iOlite could author, whether its developers realize these or not. The <a href="http://www.danko-nikolic.com/practopoietic-hierarchy/">practopoetic hierarchy</a> of the FAE provides working experimentation and research capacity which could theoretically prove or disprove that a non-biological system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)#Homuncular_functionalism">can have a mind</a>, given that it contains the same functional constituents.</p><p><em>If proven</em>, iOlite would be one of the most important inventions of all time, close to language itself. It would establish first contact with a sentient machine. The birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI). <a href="https://www.techemergence.com/welcome-to-ai-kindergarten-a-path-to-machine-genomes/">The path to machine genomes.</a> The sublime form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">human-computer interaction.</a></p><blockquote><em>…AGI may require machines to create their own algorithms i.e., machines that learn to learn… machines are not left alone to figure out on their own the necessary algorithms, but they are heavily guided through human feedback…[which] comes in a form of everyday interactions but also in a form of scientific </em><strong><em>knowledge</em></strong><em> about development of species and individuals. Information obtained from humans is integrated through a computational process that corresponds to the biological function of sleep and dreams… AGI created that way has no danger of going rogue. It is completely safe while maximally benefiting humanity.</em> — <a href="http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Machines-that-dream-Nikolic.pdf">Danko Nikolic</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01017/full">Fittingly</a>, I will let Leiber have the last words, again:</p><blockquote>…language isn’t something we invented but something we became, not something we constructed but something in which we created, and recreated, ourselves.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j6RIobjudStaPw4tMXV6PQ.png" /><figcaption>If nothing else, iOlite may <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes">guide</a> us over the bridge, from human to machine.</figcaption></figure><p>¹ As of March 7th 2018.<br>² “…digitally coded information that can act as a constructor and has resiliency — the capacity, once it is instantiated in physical systems, to remain so instantiated.” — <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-constructor-theory-solves-the-riddle-of-life">Chiara Marletto</a><br>³ Consciousness Explained — <em>Daniel C.

I just moved to “regular” beta! Yay for more betas! The private beta had two goals:</p><ol><li><strong>Technical</strong>: sanity check on the code and infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Business</strong>: Get initial user feedback on features and usability.</li></ol><p>Here’s how it went and what I learned.</p><h3>Getting signups</h3><p>I opened up a Mailchimp mail list and added a subscription box to Checkly’s homepage. My goal was to get 💯signups and then start sending invites. 100 does not sound like a lot, but given my budget and timelines I thought it would be enough to give the infrastructure a workout and get enough initial feedback to move to the next stage.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QSCP0dUL73z2B5EEH8FESQ.png" /><figcaption>Homepage with beta signup</figcaption></figure><p>Inviting someone to sign up for a <strong>free</strong> private beta is vastly different than asking money for it. That’s why I wanted the private beta to be short and sweet, because it does not really tell me anything about the validity of the business.</p><p>To get actual signups, I used the following methods. Disclaimer: I had 0.0 social media following or any audience to speak of. One of my Github projects has 69 stars ✨…</p><h4><strong>1. Social Media &amp; Blogging</strong></h4><p>My first strategy was to start blogging about building Checkly. Exactly as I am doing right now. Two blog posts did pretty well: one syndicated through <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hackernoon</a> and one via <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>. This generated by far the best stream of signups. The one about Vue.js did best.</p><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/five-things-i-learned-building-a-saas-app-with-vue-js-90b6a5acd275">Five things I learned building a Saas App with Vue.js</a></p><p><strong>!! extra free 1337 growth h4x !! </strong>I spend quite some time on the blog posts. Most of ‘m are about a 9 minute read. They come with a lot of custom images and diagrams. They come with a nice colourful hero image, courtesy of my Art History degree. No cheap click bait. Apparently people like that. Shocker. 😱</p><h4>2. Meetups</h4><p>I arranged to be a speaker at the Vue.js and Node.js meetups here in Berlin. Specifically the Node.js meetup was a big success. Major turnout, lot’s of interest from developers from the Berlin developer community. Attributing signups is a bit hard, but my gut says the effort was worth it. It was also just fun to do.</p><p><strong>!! extra</strong> <strong>free 1337 growth h4x !! </strong>I was very sneaky by either turning a blog post into a talk or vice versa. Two birds with one stone &amp; rather lazy than tired!</p><h4>3. Free tools</h4><p>I built a spin-off tool from Checkly at <a href="https://puppeteersandbox.com">https://puppeteersandbox.com</a>. Checkly uses the Puppeteer Node.js framework under the hood to automate browser interactions so most of the infrastructure was already in place. Puppeteer sandbox is like JsFiddle or CodeSandbox, but for Puppeteer Node.js scripts.</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>Did a small (big) update to the puppeteer sandbox runner I had.

There was even a small pop-up in the corner that would prompt people to sign up for Checkly. It has/had some usage, but I really need to put more effort into it as I’m planning to keep this free tool around for some time.</p><h4><strong>4. Beta list</strong></h4><p>I’m on the fence about Beta list. I signed up, paid for the most basic plan. I got some traffic and some signups. I’m however a bit skeptical about the value of their traffic.</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>Checkly: Active monitoring for developers and startups <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/2Y3ofzkD2m">https://t.co/2Y3ofzkD2m</a></p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/BetaList/status/951809343678238720">@BetaList</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><p>It seems like their tweets to 50k+ followers fall on dead ears and are just retweeted by bots about 160 times. Exactly for every product with a variance of about 5/10 tweets. I assume the best intentions from Betalist’s side. I did however opt for the refund which they gave without any fuss.</p><h4>4. Twitter Ads</h4><p>I spent €100 on Twitter ads. I got a ton of impressions and quite some clicks: that’s the easy part. I got about 3 signups.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vjEPg3IwS0heLvGEGFoK6Q.png" /><figcaption>Twitter’s ad dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>This is probably due to me being a complete noob with regard to targeting, segmenting, timing, ad copy etc. etc. Props to the Twitter team for making the tools themselves easy to use and quite powerful. This is something I need to revisit at a later stage.</p><p>In the end a bit over 200 people signed up. This was more than the 100 I aimed for! Turns out, 200 people signing up for your beta does not mean all 200 actually log in and start using your app. Shocker ! About 110 people actually logged in and did stuff in the app, so about a 50% drop off rate</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0tQ7xk9yQL-v6RHtcY8TAA.png" /><figcaption>Google Analytics showing signup attribution</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gXlPFyPYJfnxH10ia7P-Xw.png" /><figcaption>Signups via Mailchimp</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Getting Advice</strong></h3><p>As I’m “flying solo” I really had the urge to level with someone in the field that has more experience on running a developer-oriented SaaS company. I reached out to TravisCI founder and ex-CEO Mathias Meyer and he gracefully agreed to meet over coffee so I could pick his brain. Mathias was incredibly friendly and supporting and dispensed some great tips about running betas and all kinds of other stuff. Since our chat, Matthias has actively reached out to founders to contact him for advice or just a chat</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>Meanwhile, if your company or team is looking for help to get over its next (or the first!) growth hurdle, or you&#39;re an individual founder or entrepreneur looking for someone for coaching or mentoring, my DMs and emails (<a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:mathias@paperplanes.de">mathias@paperplanes.de</a>) are open.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/roidrage/status/961630606194069504">@roidrage</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><p><strong>!! extra</strong> <strong>free 1337 growth h4x !!: </strong>Ask advice from someone in the field.

The signup email everyone got made explicit mention of this and encouraged people to use that widget for any bugs, wishes, thoughts or whatever.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4TCqOWjlSYlkq-yKTpqZWQ.png" /><figcaption>Welcome email explicitly asking for feedback</figcaption></figure><p>This worked fantastic.

Some things were actually important, but it turns out most things are not. I hate to regurgitate startup lore, but “doing things that don’t scale” and “you’re probably not gonna need that” are very, very true. So, here’s a short list of things I didn’t do:</p><ul><li>A real “invite” system. I just mass emailed all signups the exact same login link.</li><li>Plan restrictions. everyone can use everything forever. I’ll deal with time- or feature limits later.</li><li>Incorporation. I didn’t ask for money, there is strictly speaking no business deal. Not yet of course. I’m working on that part as we speak.</li><li>CI/CD, automation etc: code was pushed using an NPM script or Heroku. I logged into servers via SSH to check when something went wrong.</li></ul><p>If you liked this article, please show your appreciation by <strong>clapping </strong>👏 below or <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_nolet"><strong>follow me on Twitter</strong></a><strong>! </strong>But wait, there’s more!</p><p>I’m building an active monitoring solution for dev &amp; ops team at <a href="https://checklyhq.com?utm_campaign=untrustedjavascript&amp;utm_source=freecodecamp">https://checklyhq.com</a>.

It’s about the exploratory nature of testing and innovation — and exploiting all the continually branching outcomes of your decisions, towards those that select higher quality areas of ignorance!</p><p>I keep returning to this area — to ask good questions in research, to explore uncomfortable or seemingly counter intuitive future directions or to test them and explore them before commitment.</p><p>So when I heard This BBC Programme, it was very interesting — about ‘not knowing’ — ignorance and how it drives science and exploration of the unknown.</p><p>This quotation, from Professor of Biology at Columbia University, Stuart Firestein, is absolutely brilliant, and worth 2 minutes of your time:</p><blockquote>“We all really want to talk about what we don’t know. What makes a great scientist is somebody who can put questions together — who can see what the really important questions are or the better questions. What I call the ‘higher quality ignorance’ as opposed to ‘low quality ignorance’ — because it comes in both varieties.</blockquote><blockquote>And this what science is really about and when you think of it that way, science becomes very engaging and very accessible and very interesting for people — and refreshing in many ways. Because we all like a puzzle after all — I mean that’s one of the things that — y’know curiosity is the thing that keeps us going and most engaged. So I want to teach science that way.</blockquote><blockquote>We know a lot of stuff but of course there is more stuff that we don’t know. And not only is there more stuff that we don’t know — but the more we know, the more we increase the amount of stuff we don’t know, because there was all that stuff that we didn’t know that we didn’t know before.</blockquote><blockquote>And then you do an experiment or gather some data and then you find out that really, there’s even more stuff we didn’t know now — that we can ask. So a whole slew of new questions.</blockquote><blockquote>An image I always like is of a circle of knowledge — but as the circle grows, as the diameter increases, so does the circumference that’s in contact with all that darkness outside the circle of light — that ignorance.</blockquote><blockquote>So as you increase knowledge, as you increase the size of the circle, you also increase the amount of ignorance you’re now in touch with. It’s a dynamic thing — not just a out there — it’s not just ‘what we don’t know’ — but it continues to grow, we continue to create it.”</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0639xsw">Is Ignorance Bliss? - BBC Radio 4</a></p><p>Enjoy.</p><p>C.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6dc94fe3519a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-greatest-enemy-of-knowledge-is-not-ignorance-it-is-the-illusion-of-knowledge-6dc94fe3519a">“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w0FZR-mfpj_BDUChXb34iw.jpeg" /><figcaption>AI-enabled business can be hard to reach</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who needs to run a business, big or small, you are inundated with articles and talks at conferences about how great AI is. You hear a lot about what it can do, about the outcomes of some sexy new research, and about vague assertions of how it will transform your business.</p><p>In truth, it can and will transform your business, but only if you can overcome the barriers to entry.</p><p>There is a lot of focus on the artificial intelligence itself; the machine learning model and its algorithms, its accuracy, and all the amazing new breakthroughs. It’s very distracting. Let me show you:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17120588/deepmusic-alexa-skill-ai-generated-music">This new Alexa skill will play music generated by artificial intelligence</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/14/microsoft-ai-can-translate-chinese-as-well-as-a-human/">Microsoft says its AI can translate Chinese as well as a human</a></p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-rules-more-of-your-life-who-rules-ai-1520933401">Artificial Intelligence Rules More of Your Life. Who Rules AI?</a></p><p>This is all well and good, and definitely worth paying attention to. But let’s face it, you’ve got a business to run. In most cases, you’re not trying to boil the ocean.</p><p>Let’s talk about the real, practical barriers to entry in AI.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A4mdPIiyAQiScG1Z3Gr0Sg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Just out of reach</figcaption></figure><h4>Datasets</h4><p>Having the right dataset is everything. If you’re attempting to classify text or images, be prepared with hundreds, if not thousands of examples. But the size of the dataset isn’t the real issue, it’s the scope.</p><p>If you’re training a model to detect logos in basketball games, your training set better be examples of logos in basketball games, not just pictures of the logos you pull from the internet. Be prepared to pull frames from your videos, and make sure you have a lot of them. If you expect the model to be able to detect logos from lots of different camera angles, lighting schemes, etc. you’ll need to have that represented in your dataset.</p><p>The same is true for judging the ‘temperature’ of your customers when they write support e-mails. You can train a model to track that, which might be very useful in customer support reporting and monitoring, but be prepared to manually label all of your sample data. And it should be YOUR e-mails. You can start with off-the-shelf sentiment analysis models, but to really get something accurate, you’ll need to use your own dataset, representing examples of real e-mails you expect to get at your company.</p><p>If this sounds hard, that is because it is hard. Its the hardest part.</p><h4>Building your own machine learning</h4><p>It might seem like the right move to do for various reasons. Perhaps you think this it’s important for intellectual property or that it will be cheaper. It’s neither.</p><p>First of all, you’d need to hire experts. Your full-stack developers aren’t machine learning engineers. There is a difference between developers and data scientists. It doesn’t mean they can’t be both, but it is not safe to assume that all your developers can build models.</p><p>Every problem has a different solution in machine learning. There are a lot of different ways to do machine learning, and the right solution is going to depend on a good understanding of the problem. There is a reason why people have P.h.D.s in machine learning. It’s hard!</p><p>Most customer I’ve talked to who have spun up their own machine learning team and attempted to build models to solve problems have seen the work take a better part of a year.</p><p>But even if you get a team to build a model for your business, you still have a long road a head of you because it needs to be integrated, deployed, and maintained. Each of those three things are different disciplines in their own right, and require unique expertise to accomplish.</p><p>To roll your own machine learning, be prepared to spend a small fortune and have at least 12 months of runway with no guarantee of success.</p><p><strong>Deploy, scale and maintain</strong></p><p>There are some great web services out there that offer machine learning as a service (MLaaS). These can be a good alternative to building your own model. In some cases, you’ll still have the dataset problem, but you might run into other issues.</p><p>Any developer can integrate an API, but there are different levels of quality when it comes to APIs. Some are good, some are terrible. Good is a measure of reliability, ease-of-use, and scalability. The current MLaaS offerings will probably be good enough for some use cases, but if you’re trying to transform your business with AI, you’re going to run into issues with these providers.</p><p>All of these providers are public API endpoints. That means you have to send your potentially sensitive or private data up to a public endpoint to be spirited away to some behind-the-scenes process you have no control over. Furthermore, you’re going to have to pay to move your data up to these endpoints. That can get expensive very quickly.</p><p>This is also not scalable as these endpoints will have to have throttles to prevent you from overloading their system. They are, after all, hosting a public-facing cloud service.</p><p>But probably the biggest barrier is going to be the dataset problem. A lot of them don’t let you train the models further, and if they do, its a separate process that requires a lot of processing and GPU acceleration to function. In can be impractical to, for example, implement the ability to teach a facial recognition system an unknown face in your media, or to correct a result that the model got wrong.</p><p>You also run the risk of deprecated APIs which can be a big pain to remedy, or changes to how the models are trained which could upend any ontology or logic you’ve built around the process.</p><h4>Get ahead of the problem</h4><p>These gaps in the current market of AI is why we started <a href="https://goo.gl/SqAt6j">Machine Box</a>. We wanted to provide developers out-of-the-box AI functionality that doesn’t require any machine learning knowledge to operate. We put the models into <a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> containers so they can run anywhere and everywhere (on premises or in the cloud), and can scale on demand.</p><p>We invented new technology to minimize the amount of data you’d need to train the model. In some cases, the models come pre-trained and no training data is required to get going. In other cases, you can teach the models new things with a single example of something. No more gathering 50 samples of a person’s face, with Machine Box, you only need a single example to get going.</p><p>Training on the fly is important as well. If something is wrong, you can teach it to the box and have it learn from its mistakes, on the fly, while you’re in production.</p><p>AI is no longer out of reach. Any developer can now implement powerful machine learning by simply running Docker and writing to an API. Maybe we are boiling the ocean!</p><figure><a href="https://goo.gl/w4Pbea"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*PZjwR1Nbluff5IMI6Y1T6g@2x.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f0f89414608f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/integrating-ai-here-are-3-problems-youre-about-to-encounter-f0f89414608f">Integrating AI?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>10 themes that will shape consumer behavior and technology</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zHEGLzO0vGFTjScpZv-Y3g.jpeg" /></figure><h4><strong>1. The world is consolidating into a single industry — technology</strong></h4><p>Granted I say this with the massive bias of just emerging from the world’s largest display of technology, but something quite profound is occurring in all enterprises. It’s been coming for years, and manifesting faster now. Essentially, if you have a business you’re in the technology business. At CES 2016 companies like Under Armour, BMW, NBC Universal, and United Healthcare proudly displayed how technology is at the core of their business. Technology is no longer a department within the world’s most admired businesses — it is the business.</p><h4><strong>2. Looking to recharge in 2016</strong></h4><p>Over the past few years we’ve seen marginal improvements in battery performance among our devices, and a massive amount of the CES show floor remains dedicated to delivering superior battery charging, emergency backup, and eventual replacement. Stock tip: the first innovator to make a big leap in the battery space would be a good bet to place on the market. If CES 2016 was any indication, solving this dilemma will be heroic for nearly every consumer product category.</p><h4><strong>3. Step changes toward the future</strong></h4><p>Hundreds of 3D printers again, thousands of Bluetooth speakers again, drones in new shapes and sizes, again. It can all feel a bit redundant, but in 2016 a few categories took some major steps toward the future. One example is the <a href="http://time.com/4172998/virtual-reality-oculus-rift-htc-vive-ces/">virtual reality space</a> — where HTC revealed their Vive virtual reality headset with an ingenious feature that detects objects in the real world and can overlay them into the virtual world. No more walking into IRL walls by accident. As an industry we’ve come to expect iPhone-level announcements each year, but in most 12-month cycles you have to appreciate the small victories.</p><h4><strong>4. The spectre of Apple looms large</strong></h4><p>Each year Apple stays at an arm’s length of CES, but increasingly over the past decade CES has represented Apple’s technology dominance with a host of accessories and services based off of its breadth of products, particularly in the mobile space. There were numerous companies at CES 2016 promoting their integration with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/homekit/">Apple’s HomeKit</a> platform (e.g. <a href="https://www.netatmo.com/">Netatmo</a>). The Apple ecosystem was alive and well in Las Vegas.</p><h4><strong>5. Securing the show floor</strong></h4><p>The Internet of Things, holds the promise of a smarter, more convenient, and intuitively connected world. It also holds the risk to our personal security and privacy. At CES 2016 there was a small section off the main floor dedicated to technology security solutions — for the home, devices, and data. I predict this section of the show will grow exponentially in the coming years. As connectedness becomes a part of all the products we buy — from sports equipment to baby monitors — everything will become inherently traceable (e.g. <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/man-arrested-in-vtech-breach-of-childrens-data/?_r=0">VTech breach</a>). Consumers will demand security and better control of these connected experiences.</p><h4><strong>6. Heading into the Great Unknown (Brands)</strong></h4><p>CES 2016 continued the trend toward exposing the massive scale of Asian manufacturers and brands most western consumers have never encountered. The average U.S. consumer might be able to recall 4–5 major TV manufacturers and maybe 2–3 tablet computer makers. That’s just the tip of the electronics iceberg, and CES displays the rest of it. Walking the showroom floor it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the redundancy of products — each trying to find their niche through price, feature or booth giveaways. The competition is packed and brands like LeTV and Skyworth look quite formidable.</p><h4><strong>7. The comeback kids</strong></h4><p>Storied brands are using their equity in new ways in 2016. Kodak, had a modest but brilliant booth showing the return of their consumer products. Smartly Kodak has licensed their brand out to external manufacturers for items like LED lighting and a 360-degree camera –The brand is immediately back into consumer’s hands. They’ve also brought back their iconic <a href="http://www.kodak.com/ek/us/en/Consumer/Products/Super8/default.htm">Super 8 film camera</a> with a new digital viewfinder. Consumers shoot film, ship it to Kodak, who processes it, scans it in 4K, and uploads it to the customer.

Mash-ups of analog and digital</strong></h4><p>In addition to the Kodak’s Super 8, there were other numerous examples of decidedly non-tech products getting a digital overhaul (e.g. <a href="http://itbed.sleepnumber.com/it">Sleep Number’s “it” bed</a>), but the one that stuck with me on the plane ride home was from Lego’s Education division. Lego released a comprehensive robotics kit called <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/lesi/elementary/wedo-2">WeDo</a> that allows students to use an existing favorite toy to further explore their STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills. Their booth showed multiple Lego vehicles and robots being controlled by phones and tablets.</p><h4><strong>9. Convenience is key</strong></h4><p>Walking through the vast rows of products at CES it’s common to periodically stop and think, “wait, why did they even make that thing?” You often realize that you are surrounded by hundreds of products that will fail, quickly. Among the sea of novelties, ideas that seemed to have the most sticking power were those that delivered greater consumer convenience. For the most part consumers aren’t seeking out entirely new behaviors — they want routine things made better. One product that I initially balked at, but then, as a dad of small children, quickly realized I wanted was the <a href="https://www.temptraq.com/">TempTraq thermometer</a>. Not having to wake up a sick kid in the middle of the night as the doctored ordered to take their temperature is truly insightful convenience. On the other hand, some products probably won’t command a consumer market (e.g. the <a href="http://www.wezzoo.com/oombrella">Oombrella</a>).</p><h4><strong>10. Moths still fly toward light</strong></h4><p>The brightest lights simply get noticed at CES and for most consumers, especially U.S. consumers, those lights still represent the latest and greatest TVs. Each year manufacturers try to find a unique feature or technology that they can promote and display ahead of the competition. Outside of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/09/lg-roll-up-tvs-flexible-oled/">LG’s fully flexible OLED display</a> in its prototype phase, 2016 presented minor improvements on the previous year. Slightly curved TVs, 8K TVs, smart TVs — we saw them all last year. But what’s different from 2015 is that 2016 will deliver a growing library of 4K content, not from the broadcast networks or cable providers, but from on-demand IPTV.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*997pPVvLxmWwD5nFbKhTiQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>LG video mosaic at CES 2016</figcaption></figure><p><em>@grantowens, CSO @CriticalMass</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bb57d566f345" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/trends-and-trajectories-from-ces-2016-bb57d566f345">Trends and Trajectories from CES 2016</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It makes sense to learn how to enjoy the process. Not just the highlights, but the tough times and trials.</p><p>I’ve played sports all my life. Looking back, I remember many of the good times and highlights. Mixed in with those highlights are some of the moments I cherish most, the hardships and struggles. The times severely tested.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The making of “Counting to a Million”</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6pifjSq4ofWUhiXa.gif" /></figure><p><em>Counting to a Million</em> is a public data sculpture tracking and predicting 50 years of Amsterdam population growth. Exploring births, deaths and changes in each suburb’s population count as the city heads towards a million residents. The sculpture blurs the lines between suburbs, crosses boundaries, and merges together in a constant push and pull, ebb and flow, as life happens, people move, die, get married and new residents arrive and are born.</p><p>I’ve always been fascinated with big public data, as an input and source to create artworks, so was super excited to be able to create <em>Amsterdam Data Project</em>, part of a year long exploration into the wonderful world of open data in Amsterdam.</p><p><em>The following is an account of how I would go about building a large-scale data project like this, and will hopefully give you some insight or inspiration into building your own.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4jK7SFKMS_T-K8H_.jpg" /></figure><h3>The Making of Counting to a Million:</h3><p>The remit of the project is to create a new data sculpture every month for six months, with the option to do another six months, using data to create artworks across the Netherlands, on Ngage’s giant media screens. Amsterdam Population Growth — Counting to a Million, was the first.</p><p><em>I am really grateful for the folks at </em><a href="http://radarboy.com/george/www.ngagemedia.nl"><em>Ngage Media</em></a><em>, the Netherlands’ leading network in Out of Home digital screens who made this happen and specifically Ngage’s Daan Krijnen. I met Daan a year earlier at Refik Anandol’s </em><a href="http://2017.fiberfestival.nl/programme/lab2-architectural-intelligence/"><em>Architectural Intelligence Lab</em></a><em> at the Fiber Festival in Amsterdam. Daan showed me the beautful giant screens at Amsterdam Central Station and I immediately fell in love with them and salivated at the chance to do something on them. He mentioned to me that Ngage were wanting to do some experimental public art projects on them, and after a few months of to-ing and fro-ing we were able to get the project underway.</em></p><p>The data sculptures were coded completely in Javascript, using libraries I’ve been developing over the past few years from my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/radarboy3000/">#Code365</a> project. The data was obtained from the wonderful <a href="https://data.amsterdam.nl/">data.amsterdam.nl</a> and thanks to the kind and generous help from Jasper Soetendal and <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/bestuur-organisatie/organisatie/overige/datalab-amsterdam/">DataLab Amsterdam</a>. I spend a long time going through all the public data before settling on population growth.</p><p>Immigration and a changing Europe being such a hot topic these days, I thought it would be interesting to see how Amsterdam has changed over time. And what we could expect from the future. I’ve been travelling to Amsterdam for years, and have always been impressed by the city’s openess and inclusiveness. Turns out Amsterdam’s growth has been pretty normal, and I would say it’s tourism that’s shaping and changing Amsterdam and Europe more than anything else, but that’s another topic- and perhaps data visualisation.</p><p>I mashed up the population data with Amsterdam Suburb data to create a location-specific data set that could be plotted on a Google Map. I might say this in a sentence, but this was a mountain of work to get the data looking and working in a way that I could start getting creative with it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SZ7T38U5k7luz5r8.jpg" /></figure><p>The data was then fed through a simple Machine Learning Neural Network to predict future population values, only to later discover Amsterdam had it’s own (much better) predictions.</p><p>Population numbers were then normalised to be able to work with more easily, and to get a better feel of changes though time. I like to sit with data like this for a while and watch it and “get to know it”.</p><p>I also plotted births and deaths in each suburb, as well and changes in population, but eventually decided on using the raw population dataset that gave me a good feel of how the population in Amsterdam had changed over time. Interestingly Amsterdam’s population was shrinking in the early 90s.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x7YypnJiKZd8CRMZ.jpg" /></figure><p>I then built attactors into the artwork. Where larger amounts pulled other suburbs closer together, showing movement as suburbs grew and shrunk over time, forming metaballs around the most populous areas.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-N8PtlSaAz4LvGtz.jpg" /></figure><p>The visualisation was then blurred and posterised, all in Javascript, getting closer to the look and feel I was wanting. However, the it was also getting way too slow (blurring is crazy heavy of the processor). I wanted them to render in realtime and despite using all the tricks in the book, learned from my more than two years of daily <a href="https://www.instagram.com/radarboy3000/">CODE365</a> coding experiments, such rendering on smaller a hidden off-screen canvas, I was still unable to get the balance of reasonable frame rate.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lPrwY6eLzJcvUAqw.gif" /></figure><p>So I went back to the drawing board, to mimic the behavior I wanted, by simplifying and making the visuals more graphic (a look that was always my endpoint anyway), merging data points that were close together, and harcoding some of the heavy map calculations. And finally the look I was wanting started to come together.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZcU5rzKkuC59QIEP.jpg" /></figure><p>All that was needed then was animate the data and make adjustments for the various screensizes, some of which have weird dimensions — Amsterdam Centraal Station has a widescreen dimension of 2112x608pm. I also gave the visualtion a layers drop shadow to give it a more depth and a slight 3D effect.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*584vc_km4CkrCecH.jpg" /></figure><p>A few days before I was due to fly out to Amsterdam to test the visualizations on the screens my mac died. My backups were days old (yes I know, commit often) — meaning I had lost critical final tweaks to the work. Two different Apple Stores and an Apple service centre told me that the control board had fried, and would take a week plus and $500 plus to repair. I paid someone to retrieve my data off my dead mac’s hard disk and bought a new Mac, so I could test and show Daan my progress. We tested a few variations of the design and it was clear the more graphic ones worked better and though white backgrounds looked awesome — they were way too bright.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ATywTcO8w7cDyBk9.jpg" /></figure><p><em>(Turned out Apple were completely wrong, despite me insisting that it wasn’t the motherboard, and the rather the battery. My new Macbook has also been giving me trouble since day one, with this battery lasting less than two hours. Apple again insisting there’s nothing wrong. Hours of support calls. Visits to the Mac store. And eventually reformatting the computer have not solved anything. When I arrived in NY to get my new mac repaired, lo and behold the old one started up immediately in the Mac Store and turns out it was a battery problem after all. My new one in the meantime, can’t be replaced, because it was bought in Amsterdam. Different part numbers or some nonsense. Hmmm. And I’ll have to send it away for repair for a week — once my old one arrives dack. The only reason I bought a new one is because Apple told me my old one was dead. 100s of hours wasted. And only “sorry there’s nothing we can do” from Apple. Rant over. But to be continued…).</em></p><p>The visualisations all run smoothly in the browser, at around 60fps. I used a simple #hash method in the url to resize the artwork for each screen. And after a few more tweaks, were ready to go live.</p><p>I’ll be getting some better documentation of the live installation soon… But in the meantime, here’s some more of the tests…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*54naQb0vtLxQoVLk.jpg" /></figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FYp8rAk5F4OQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYp8rAk5F4OQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FYp8rAk5F4OQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/eac6f63dcaaa3462389afbab0308dd63/href">https://medium.com/media/eac6f63dcaaa3462389afbab0308dd63/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Amsterdam Counting to a Million</strong> is viewable January through July 2018 on the giant mediascreens at Amsterdam Centraal Station, Leidsplein and Amsterdam-Zuid WTC.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="http://radarboy.com/george/www.ngagemedia.nl">Ngage Media</a>, the Netherlands’ leading network in Out of Home digital screens and specifically Ngage’s Daan Krijnen for supporting this project.</p><p>If you want to get started in creative coding, I have a bunch of tutorials <a href="https://medium.com/@radarboy3000">here</a>.</p><p><strong>And please follow me here if you so desire:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/radarboy3000/"><strong>https://www.instagram.com/radarboy3000/</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/radarboy_japan"><strong>https://twitter.com/radarboy_japan</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/radarboy3000"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/radarboy3000</strong></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=64ba53e7d70" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-amsterdam-data-project-01-64ba53e7d70">The Amsterdam Data Project #01</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started programming, no one was talking about Agile, and BigDesignUpfront ruled the day. In college, we were taught to pseudocode our homework before coding it. Our assignments included OOP diagrams, UML, flowcharts, function prototypes and other design documentation. When I started my first job, I was handed a 4 page spec and told “This has all the answers, get to work.”</p><p>My boss sat in the office across from my cubicle, had weekly one-on-one meetings with me, did performance evaluations, held team meetings, and (of course) tried to spend as much time coding as she could. Like any good Team Lead, she coded at least 50% of the time (per company policy.)</p><p>Things were pretty good to be honest. Oh, I quickly learned the specs weren’t perfect (or complete, or even very useful) and interviewing users became an important part of my job. The small team of 8 programmers figured out a way to build software that kept both users AND management happy (no small task!) without too much stress.</p><p><strong>Company growth = painful change</strong></p><p>As the team grew from 8 to 18 to 28 to 60, the process changed (for the worse.) The pressure from management increased, we had less interactions with actual users, because a new role (the Business Systems Analyst) was created to insulate the programmers from those pesky users. The specs got bigger (100+ page specs were very common), the meetings got longer, and the programming team was expected to stay “heads down coding” 90% of the time. Needless to say, this wasn’t much fun for anyone in the Software Department (yup, now we were an official “department” with 8 “teams”.)</p><p>One day someone brought a new book to the office, Extreme Programming by Kent Beck. It got passed around the software team with some excitement, as people were desperate for stories of empowered, respected programmers working on successful projects. More agile books appeared, and those were circulated. Management thought it was kinda crazy, and the BSAs didn’t care about it, but the programmers were infected. For years after that the internal developer meetings discussed how can we “go agile” and “try scrum”.</p><p>Finally management agreed that developers could try being “agile”, probably for fear of a developer mutiny. The team was thrilled, and we scheduled our initial project stand-ups, following agile’s advice to invite everyone from the BSAs, Project Managers, to Users, to Team Leads and all the programmers. Everyone showed up for the first few meetings, but quickly the the BSAs, PMs and Users stopped attending. Disappointed, the developers carried on the practice (if for no other reason than it’s what our agile manual told us to do).</p><p><strong>“Yes, we use agile”</strong></p><p>During this process I was promoted to Team Lead, and eventually to Assistant Manager of the department. One of my key responsibilities was hiring, and I can still remember the first time a candidate asked me, “Do you use an agile process?” Internally I thought, “Ha! No, not really.” but before I could answer my boss said, “Yes, we use agile.” I remember thinking, “Wait, really?” I realized in that moment that management wanted us to be perceived as agile, even though we weren’t actually using (or benefiting) from agile. Subtly I wondered if this was to placate the developers, or hire candidates who were passionate about agile, or so the CIO could tell his golf buddies they had adopted this new trend.</p><p>Going back to my office, I pondered this. Agile had become more than a process, more than a buzzword. It had become an banner management could raise to say: we have a quality software process that respects developers. But nothing could be farther from the truth.</p><p>In addition, I found that management expected developers to be happier now that we were working in an agile way. When developers complained we weren’t doing agile “right”, management pointed to the many variations of agile and defended the one we used. Sometimes managers would become Certified ScrumMasters, thus giving them more credibility (and power?) to affirm that we were doing agile “the right way.”</p><p><strong>Numb is easier than Mad</strong></p><p>Like most middle managers, I kept my mouth shut and soldiered on, living with the dissonance. When my developers complained, I pointed out that at least we weren’t still using waterfall (like in the “old days”, when I was a programmer.) When upper management complained, I pointed out that agile kept the developer happy, and that we were continuing to improve on it. In hindsight, it was duplicitous and disingenuous and I’m not proud of it.</p><p>I wish I could say that I had a “Network” (the 1976 movie) moment, where I proclaimed <em>“I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore!” </em>But I didn’t.</p><p>Instead, I got numb. Jaded. Seared and scabbed. This turned to hopelessness and apathy. I needed the job, I loved the people, so I found solace in the thought that I could provide my team with a manager who cared about them.</p><p>So, I filled a seat, punched the clock, and disconnected my brain.</p><p><strong>The Lesson isn’t about Agile</strong></p><p>It would be easy to think that the big company is the villain of the story, but you’d be wrong.</p><p>If it’s not the company, then maybe it was the CIO, or my immediate boss, or the BSA’s who refused to participate in the agile process. Wrong again.</p><p>I am the villain of this story, fully responsible for my unwillingness to act. Willing to become a disengaged, unmotivated manager. Willing to be duplicitous for the sake of a paycheck.</p><p>So, if this sounds familiar to where you are right now, I hope you are braver than I was. That you can find a way to care again, to re-engage and fight for what’s right.</p><p>Or, if this looks like someone who works for you, maybe you can talk to them in a new way. A way that invites them to get mad, to express themselves, and to care again.</p><p>Life’s too short to coast in neutral. Too short to fill a seat, play buzzword bingo, or become numb to the stupidity around you.</p><p>Take a chance, use your words, and fight for change.</p><p>And watch Network, just once. ;)</p><figure><a href="https://goo.gl/w4Pbea"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*PZjwR1Nbluff5IMI6Y1T6g@2x.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=627c7af66dc3" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/agile-apathy-627c7af66dc3">Agile Apathy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But for now I feel compelled by the unanimous praise for this Jonze/FKA Twigs project to scream out:</em><strong><em> ‘what the hell is the matter with everyone?!’</em></strong></p><p>As you will know by now, Spike Jonze has directed a four-minute ad for Apple’s HomePod smart speaker that stars musician and dancer FKA Twigs. There is so much wrong with this video that in this short rant it is difficult to fit everything in, but I’ll attempt a brief summary.</p><p>By taking advantage of consumers’ preferred use of their home assistant to stream music, Apple has tapped into the joy we all know of losing ourselves to the rhythm of a song.</p><blockquote><strong>The Verge said:</strong> “I can’t stop playing Apple’s clever new HomePod ad”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Adweek:</strong> “Spike Jonze and FKA twigs Made a Jaw-Dropping Short Film for Apple’s HomePod”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Nerdist: </strong>“Spike Jonze’s New Apple Ad Is an Amazing Music Video”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>creativity-online: </strong>“FKA Twigs Dances Her Way Out of Depression in Spike Jonze’s Film for Apple HomePod”</blockquote><p>Are we to believe that dancing around your apartment is all that’s needed to confront the debilitating condition of depression? Jonze encapsulates in 4 minutes all that’s wrong with today’s Western culture. Demoralised by her contemporary urban lifestyle, lacking an ability to select music for herself, the defeated young woman asks what will eventually become a standard AI home surveillance system to choose which music she should dance her cares away to — in a short-lived, and realistically anticlimactic, state of blissful ignorance.</p><p><strong>Is “Apple’s clever new HomePod ad” really that clever? Or is it vapid?</strong></p><p>It’s important to contrast this ad with Ridley Scott’s now-legendary ‘1984’ Apple commercial. Arguably, the emptiness of this new ad represents the marked decline in relative creative innovation in both Apple and popular culture in general spanning the decades since that 1-minute piece aired during the 1984 Super Bowl. <strong>The glaring irony is that the 1984 ad introduced a new product to the world by literally showing the smashing of authoritarian power, to represent a rejecting of conformity; the 2018 ad introduces a new product while surreptitiously portraying consumer capitulation to the surveillance state. </strong>When assessing Jonze’s video in this light, the regressive reality today becomes quite startling.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FVtvjbmoDx-I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVtvjbmoDx-I&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FVtvjbmoDx-I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/e1f692841a8ca5d8b1229ec633a2b36f/href">https://medium.com/media/e1f692841a8ca5d8b1229ec633a2b36f/href</a></iframe><p>Jonze’s master-stroke (on behalf of not only Apple but also Amazon and Google) is in mesmerising his audience with an illusion, while the message of normalising the practice of surveillance goes unnoticed.</p><p>There is only one thing that is truly clever about the ad and that is how the message makes its way into the anesthetised and indoctrinated minds of unsuspecting millennials. <strong>This film is a harbinger of a new dystopian reality which we will have to learn to navigate.</strong></p><p>I so far cannot find anyone analysing the piece critically. All I’ve found is relentless gushing over how amazing it apparently is. Can people not readily identify that the video’s aim is to normalise the authoritarian practices of Western surveillance states? <strong>Has everyone really forgotten what Edward Snowden revealed about NSA surveillance?</strong></p><p>Apart from the fact that this really is not that ground-breaking— creatively speaking, for years designers have experimented with interesting ways of extending objects into kaleidoscopic lines and patterns — we must look beyond the setting to the more serious issues.</p><p>Firstly, if you watch the disturbingly nonchalant Alexa Prize Finals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTGuOg7GXYU">video</a>, you will learn how researchers are working on advancing conversational AI so that we will be more comfortable having conversations with <strong><em>machines</em></strong> in the near future:</p><blockquote>“<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">Amazon</a> announces the 2018 teams selected to compete for the Alexa Prize, a $3.5 million university challenge to advance human-computer interaction. These teams will create socialbots that can converse coherently and engagingly with humans on a range of current events and popular topics such as entertainment, sports, politics, technology, and fashion.”</blockquote><p>You must consider with this, the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06006.pdf">research</a> from Baidu in voice cloning from <a href="https://audiodemos.github.io/">samples</a>. In the future, the Spike Jonze version of an AI operating system in his 2013 film ‘Her’ (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) will indeed become a reality. Moreover, our AI assistant could potentially be voiced by any public figure, actress or actor we choose — by way of the fact that their voice has been recorded so often.</p><p><strong>Next, keeping this in mind, let’s examine where this technology is going.</strong></p><p>Prior to Apple’s new release, there have already been patent applications by Amazon and Google — whose links to the US intelligence community are well documented — for new technology that will greatly expand surveillance and data-sharing of consumers’ information through the smart-speaker market.</p><p><a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/2017-12/Digital%20Assistants%20and%20Privacy.pdf">This</a> Consumer Watchdog report from December 2017 revealed the extent to which the technological capabilities of digital assistants and smart home devices will inevitably increase. Among the many details in the patent applications are:</p><blockquote>“A system for deriving sentiments and behaviors from <strong>ambient speech</strong>, even when a user has not addressed the device”</blockquote><blockquote>“Multiple systems for <strong>identifying speakers</strong> in a conversation and building interest profiles for each one.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Google may share data from smart home devices with third parties,including businesses, who can then use the data to<strong> make inferences about users’ sleeping, cooking, entertainment, and showering schedules</strong>”</blockquote><blockquote>“… voice fingerprinting to identify the presence of children and motion sensors to detect activity, and reports<strong> inferred mischief when children are both active and quiet.</strong>”</blockquote><p>Smart speaker systems in a passive listening state will capture and analyse all speech that will happen nearby. They will be able to identify those speaking and build a profile on them that goes beyond marketing data collection, as noted <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/19/voice-recognition-technology-nsa/">here</a>: “documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden reveal that the NSA has developed technology not just to record and transcribe private conversations but to automatically identify the speakers.” And the makers of these devices are connected directly to the government: think of for example Jeff Bezos having a government cloud-computing contract.</p><p>This month Apple made their smart-speaker a highly desirable object. Or should I say, Spike Jonze and FKA Twigs have achieved this? Even a cynic like myself has in previous years had much admiration for both of these artists, particularly Jonze in the late 90s. After seeing this latest creative venture, my advice would be to never purchase a smart speaker and always be suspicious of creative types that sell-out to the big corporations.</p><p>More to follow…</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F305ryPvU6A8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D305ryPvU6A8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F305ryPvU6A8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/4f24b7d2c5ee04848d81cace00a787ff/href">https://medium.com/media/4f24b7d2c5ee04848d81cace00a787ff/href</a></iframe><p><em>Ed Hannan is an independent Media and Culture Analyst, Photographer, Designer, Musicologist who can be found </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hannan"><em>here</em></a><em> &amp; </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ed.hannan.96"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hannan">Ed Hannan (@ed_hannan) | Twitter</a></p><figure><a href="https://goo.gl/w4Pbea"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*PZjwR1Nbluff5IMI6Y1T6g@2x.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=25cff1b32f4e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/lets-dance-into-the-dystopian-surveillance-state-25cff1b32f4e">Let’s dance… into the dystopian surveillance state</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Beautiful is better than ugly — be consistent.</p><p>2. Complex is better than complicated — use existing libraries.</p><p>3. Simple is better than complex — keep it simple and stupid (KISS).</p><p>4. Flat is better than nested — avoid nested ifs.</p><p>5. Explicit is better than implicit — be clear.</p><p>6. Sparse is better than dense — separate code into modules.</p><p>7. Readability counts — indenting for easy readability.</p><p>8. Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules — everything is an object.</p><p>9. Errors should never pass silently — good exception handler.</p><p>10. Although practicality beats purity — if required, break the rules.</p><p>11. Unless explicitly silenced — error logging and traceability.</p><p>12. In ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess — Python syntax is simpler; however, many times we might take a longer time to decipher it.</p><p>13. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch — there is not only one of way of achieving something.</p><p>14. There should be preferably only one obvious way to do it — use existing libraries.</p><p>15. If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea — if you can’t explain in simple terms then you don’t understand it well enough.</p><p>16. Now is better than never — there are quick/dirty ways to get the job done rather than trying too much to optimize.</p><p>17. Although never is often better than *right* now — although there is a quick/dirty way, don’t head in the path that will not allow a graceful way back.</p><p>18. Namespaces are one honking great idea, so let’s do more of those! — be specific.</p><p>19. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea — simplicity.</p><h3>Reference:</h3><p>— <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Machine-Learning-Python-Steps/dp/1484228650">https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Machine-Learning-Python-Steps/dp/1484228650</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2a4d3febc903" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/19-coding-rules-that-every-coder-must-know-mastering-machine-learning-with-python-in-six-steps-2a4d3febc903">[Note] 19 Coding Rules that every coder must know</a> was originally published in <a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hacker Noon</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
